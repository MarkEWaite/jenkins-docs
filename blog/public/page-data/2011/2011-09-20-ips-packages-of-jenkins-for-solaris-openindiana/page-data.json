While I have my doubts about whether a brand-new package manager was a good way of spending engineering resources, OpenSolaris had a number of very nice features that made it a convincing platform to run Jenkins, thanks to SMF, ZFS, and zones. So I used to produce IPS packages for Jenkins. I lost the ability to do this as I left Oracle and lost access to a Solaris system, but <a href=\"https://www.dev-eth0.de/jenkins-continuous-integration-on-opensolaris/\">a recent blog post</a> renewed my interest.<br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So I&#8217;m happy to announce that the Jenkins project has started producing <a href=\"https://ips.jenkins-ci.org/\">IPS packages for the releases</a>.
