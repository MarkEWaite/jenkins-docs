Could you please share your experience?</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It seems, to me at least, the notion of \"release engineering\" is making a come-back, particularly in the aging \"Web 2.0\" world where companies like Digg, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc are anywhere from five to ten years old. As these companies have aged a couple of important things have happened, their code-base has aged increasing the possibility of bitrot, but they have also expanded in terms of headcount. Start-ups that might have once slighted larger corporations like Oracle, Cisco VMWare and IBM for their burdensome process and longer release schedules now find themselves ensnared with massive code bases, larger development teams and complicated deployments.<center>image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_vs_buildbot.png</center></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the past few months we&#8217;ve seen Hudson being used in a number of different contexts, it was <a href=\"/content/hudson-pycon\">pitched at PyCon</a> as part of a larger appeal to the Python community to get on the continuous integration bandwagon, we&#8217;ve seen a few posts from developers using Hudson for testing and packaging <a href=\"/content/getting-started-building-android-apps-hudson\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://manicwave.com/blog/2010/03/01/that-feels-better-cocoa-hudson-and-running-green/\">iPhone apps</a>, .NET developers are <a href=\"https://bobcravens.com/2010/03/01/getting-started-with-ci-using-hudson-for-your-net-projects/\">jumping on board as well</a>.
