The original Jenkins logo was created by our friends at https://frontside.io/[Frontside]. Special thanks to https://github.com/cowboyd[Charles Lowell] for his efforts championing the logo's original design. Usage guidelines for the original logo can be found on our https://www.jenkins.io/press[Press] page. This page simply catalogues the many clever variations of Jenkins created by members of the Jenkins community.
