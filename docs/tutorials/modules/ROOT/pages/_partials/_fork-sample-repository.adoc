== Fork the sample repository on GitHub

Fork the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js and React application on GitHub into your own GitHub account.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account.
If you don't yet have a GitHub account, sign up for a free on the https://github.com/[GitHub website].
. Fork the https://github.com/jenkins-docs/creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean[`creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean`]
repository on GitHub into your local GitHub account.
If you need help with this process, refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork a repo] documentation on the GitHub website for more information.

NOTE: This is a different repository than the one used in the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[build a Node.js and React app with npm] tutorial.
Although these repositories contain the same application code, ensure you fork and use the correct one before continuing.
