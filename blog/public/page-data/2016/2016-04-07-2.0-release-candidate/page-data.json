If you have the\ncycles to help test, please <a href=\"/2.0/\">download the release candidate</a> and give\nus your feedback as soon as possible!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The release candidate process also means that changes targeting release <strong>after</strong>\n2.0 can start landing in the <code>master</code> branch, laying the groundwork 2.1 and\nbeyond.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I pushed the merge to 'master'. So anything targeting 2.1+ can be now proposed\nin pull requests to that branch.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Anything happening on '2.0' branch will be limited to critical fixes for the 2.0\nrelease specifically.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n&#8212; Daniel Beck\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Compared to the\n<a href=\"/blog/2016/03/24/jenkins-2-beta-released/\">2.0 beta release</a>, the first\nrelease candidate has a number of fixes for issues discovered in the alpha and beta\nprocess. Most notable perhaps is the stabilization of a system property which\nconfiguration management tools, like Puppet/Chef/Ansible/etc, can use to suppress\nthe user-friendly Getting Started wizard. Since users of those tools\nhave alternative means of ensuring security and correctness of their Jenkins\ninstallations, the out-of-the-box experience can be skipped.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Based on our\n<a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0#Jenkins2.0-RoughTimeline\">rough\ntimeline</a> this gives us a couple weeks to test the release candidates and get\nready for a big exciting release of 2.0 at the end of April!</p>\n</div>","document":{"title":"Jenkins 2.0 Release Candidate available!","main":"Jenkins 2.0 Release Candidate available!"},"author":{"fullName":"tags:"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6814b394-0da1-5a6e-9886-ce9f35c788b7"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
