I tried setting up well-known projects like Django, Brave browser, and Chromium but failed miserably. I didn’t know that open source is not about projects but about community. Gradually I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\">freeCodeCamp</a>. That’s where I wrote my first test case and fixed minor bugs. I gained the confidence to continue contributing to open source.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Two months later it was time for GSoC. I started late but wanted to make it anyhow. <a href=\"https://world.openfoodfacts.org/\">OpenFoodFacts</a> turned out to be the best-suited project for me. I did not make it to GSoC 2022 but built a lifelong relationship with the mentors. They groomed, tutored, and mentored me. They made me the open-source contributor I am today.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_education_and_work\">Education and Work</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I hold a master’s degree in computer application. I work at one of the reputed organizations in India as a Senior Project Engineer. My total work experience is around 4 years.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_why_jenkins\">Why Jenkins?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I have worked for the longest time in Java. I was looking to contribute to Java projects during Hacktoberfest 2022. It was a weekend when the fest started. I decided to give a try to a project that seems difficult from the outside. I commented on different issues and asked for guidance and explanation. That’s when Mark Waite came to the rescue. He was my mentor throughout. After making a couple of documentation fixes I remember writing a simple test to test a constructor. He showed me how it could be done. The next day I remember bragging to my colleagues about contributing to Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A few days later Jean-March Meessen set up a call with me. He asked about my experience in open source, contributing to Jenkins, what I do, my future open-source plans, etc. When the call ended I wanted to be a part of a community where there are more people like him.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_why_plugin_health_scoring_system\">Why Plugin Health Scoring System?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After Hacktoberfest, I contributed to different plugins. Modernized them, fixed minor bugs, wrote test cases, etc. When Jenkins' ideas list for GSoC 2023 was out, I tried contributing to a couple of projects in the list. Projects required skills like ReactJs, Antora, and Docker. I found I was short of time to pick those skills and make an attempt to write a decent proposal.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I made my first PR to Plugin Health Scoring System. It was merged in 3-4 days. This was my fastest merged PR. I understood Adrien’s instructions and did not stray from the solution. This gave me the confidence to apply to Plugin Health Score for GSoC 2023. Once the PR was merged, I asked the community if I should work on the proposal or make more contributions. Mentors unanimously suggested it’s time I start with the proposal.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I started with the daft proposal in Feb 2023. After multiple rounds of review until the last submission date, I always thought I should add something more to make it slightly better.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_how_will_the_community_benefit_from_my_gsoc_contribution\">How will the community benefit from my GSoC contribution</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>My project is titled “Adding Probes to Plugin Health Score”. As the title suggests I have proposed to add as many probes as possible to determine a plugin&#8217;s health.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_what_are_probes\">What are <code>probes</code>?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Probes are nothing but data that compute the health score of the plugin. The score is computed based on the data collected by the probe. Based on this score, the future contributors and maintainers, adopters decide which plugin they want to invest their time in.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_what_will_i_do_during_this_gsoc_period\">What will I do during this GSoC period?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Designing the probes</p>\n<div class=\"olist loweralpha\">\n<ol class=\"loweralpha\" type=\"a\">\n<li>\n<p>Identify the key features and functionality of the plugins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Define the metrics that would contribute to the Plugin Health Score.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The more probe criteria the plugin meets, the higher the health score of the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deciding the probe’s interaction with other probes</p>\n<div class=\"olist loweralpha\">\n<ol class=\"loweralpha\" type=\"a\">\n<li>\n<p>Decide the order in which a probe should be executed by the scheduler (Which probe should be executed first, second, and so on).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Determining how the probe would contribute to the score</p>\n<div class=\"olist loweralpha\">\n<ol class=\"loweralpha\" type=\"a\">\n<li>\n<p>Give each probe a weightage (coefficient).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the probe criteria are met with a plugin.
