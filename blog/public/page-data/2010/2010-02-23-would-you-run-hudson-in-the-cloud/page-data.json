About 10 months ago Kohsuke <a href=\"https://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/05/18/hudson-ec2-plugin\">announced the Hudson EC2 plugin</a> which has seen slow, but steady development since then, including support for the <a href=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/private\">Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud</a> which was added to the plugin in a release last Monday.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As The Build Doctor and his readers point out, continuous integration is a difficult task to offload into the cloud because of the immense hardware demands constant building and testing presents. That said, Hudson <em>does</em> very effectively manage spinning agents up and down on demand if you&#8217;ve configured it as such. Implication being: running Hudson in the cloud may be more efficient to meet peak demands without needing to run a large farm of machines.<span class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_in_the_cloud.png\" alt=\"hudson in the cloud\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying out the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Plugin\">EC2 plugin</a>, check out <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/\">Sonatype&#8217;s</a> post on <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/people/2009/06/nexus-open-source-and-hudson-on-ec2/\">Nexus Open Source and Hudson on EC2</a> might be a good start.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Would you run Hudson in the cloud?</p>\n</div>","document":{"title":"Would you run Hudson in the cloud?","main":"Would you run Hudson in the cloud?"},"author":{"fullName":"---"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c3b7904a-2c47-5445-b843-efd0bc8624f3"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
