= Initial Settings

Most Jenkins configuration changes can be made through the Jenkins user interface or through the plugin:configuration-as-code[configuration as code plugin].
There are some configuration values that can only be modified while Jenkins is starting.
This section describes those settings and how you can use them.

== Jenkins Parameters

Jenkins initialization can also be controlled by run time parameters passed as arguments.
Command line arguments can adjust networking, security, monitoring, and other settings.
