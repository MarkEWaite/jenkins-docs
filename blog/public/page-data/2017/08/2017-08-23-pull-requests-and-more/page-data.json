href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World 2017</a>\nwill include the \"Pull Requests Corner\", recruiting new Jenkins contributors.\nWe think there are many people who will attend the conference without realizing how easy it is\nto help the Jenkins project, and how much the help is appreciated.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Meet us in the \"Pull Requests Corner\" and we&#8217;ll help you find a way to help Jenkins.\nHere are some areas where we can use your help.\nMost of them do not require coding, and do not require a large time commitment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_one_minute_feedback_on_your_version\">One Minute Feedback on Your Version</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins changelog pages (<a href=\"/changelog-stable/\">LTS</a> and <a href=\"/changelog/\">weekly</a>) gather user experiences with specific Jenkins versions.\nYou can help other Jenkins users by clicking one of the weather icons in the <a href=\"/changelog-stable/\">LTS changelog</a> (or the <a href=\"/changelog/\">weekly changelog</a>) for the release you&#8217;re using.\nChangelog feedback from weekly releases helps the release team select the long term support version.\nChangelog feedback from LTS releases helps other users prepare to upgrade.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It takes less than a minute, and helps the community (which will ultimately help you).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2

id=\"_twenty_minutes_for_a_bug\">Twenty Minutes for a Bug</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa\">Jenkins bug tracker</a> contains thousands of bugs.\nReviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports takes time.\nWhen maintainers are reviewing, duplicating, and clarifying bug reports, they are <strong>not</strong> fixing bugs, and they are <strong>not</strong> adding new capabilities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can help maintainers by reviewing and duplicating a bug report that matters to you.\nA comment on a bug report is especially helpful when it confirms you&#8217;ve been able to duplicate the bug.\nIt is even more helpful if your verification includes the steps you took and how they differ from the original report.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A bug report which has been duplicated, and includes <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/How+to+report+an+issue\">clear instructions</a>, is much more likely to receive maintainer attention.\nHelp yourself and others by duplicating bugs that matter to you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_thirty_minutes_for_documentation\">Thirty Minutes for Documentation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div

href=\"/doc/developer/\">tutorial</a>, <a href=\"/doc/developer/guides/\">how-to guides</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/developer/book/\">reference</a>).\nYou can help the documentation by describing something important to you clearly and completely.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-documentation\">instructions for documentation contributors</a> to see how easy it is to help.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_forty_five_minutes_for_translation\">Forty Five Minutes for Translation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If English is not your native language, you can help with Jenkins localization.\nJenkins is used worldwide, and many users will benefit from translations.\nConsidering the rapid and continuing evolution of Jenkins, it is no surprise that there is plenty to translate.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Internationalization\">internationalization guide</a> for instructions to help you contribute translations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_sixty_minutes_for_a_meetup\">Sixty Minutes for a Meetup</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Local groups around the world meet often for Jenkins presentations, discussions, and demonstrations.\nOrganizing a <a href=\"/projects/jam/\">Jenkins Area Meetup</a> will introduce you to other users, and will let you explore new ways to benefit

Jenkins plugin ecosystem covers a wide range of areas.\nJenkins plugin maintainers come from many different backgrounds, with many different interests.\nOften, a plugin maintainer may find that they want to do something different on the project, or they may leave the project.\nWhen a plugin maintainer is no longer able to maintain a plugin, they can <a href=\"/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/\">place it for adoption</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Plugins placed for adoption range from very specific use cases (node stalker plugin) to very general use cases (Subversion plugin).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Maintaining an orphan plugin is a great way to contribute to the project.\nFollow the instructions to \"<a href=\"/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/\">Adopt a Plugin</a>\".</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_see_you_there\">See You
